            <p>I have a sister and her name is Elsa. When I was young, I didn’t know why my sister was not hanging out with me. 
            She always stayed inside her room and every time I asked her to hang out, she always refused. 
            Our castle was always locked up, and I felt frustrated because I didn't get any chance to explore the outside world and meet new people. 
            However, Arendelle had a coronation day on Elsa’s 21st birthday. I was more than excited because it was my first opportunity to meet new people. 
            I even imagined how wonderful it would be if I met someone who I can fall in love with. 
            Before coronation day, I composed a song called “For the first time in forever”. Click the image to watch the music video.</p>

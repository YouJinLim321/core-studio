            <p>I have a sister and her name is Elsa. When I was young, I didn’t know why my sister was not hanging out with me. She always stayed inside her room and every time I asked her to hang out, she always refused. Our castle was always locked up, and I felt frustrated because I didn't get any chance to explore the outside world and meet new people. However, Arendelle had a coronation day on Elsa’s 21st birthday. I was more than excited because it was my first opportunity to meet new people. I even imagined how it wonderful it would be if I met someone who I can fall in love with. Before coronation day, I composed a song called “For the first time in forever”. It is the song that I composed with my fluttered heart before coronation.</p>
